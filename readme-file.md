# Qualitative Coding Network Visualization

An interactive network visualization exploring the rhetoric-reality gap in interdisciplinary education implementation at universities.

## Overview

This repository hosts an interactive visualization accompanying the qualitative analysis of SPARC Transcript 4507, featuring an in-depth interview with the Director of Kilachand Honors College at Boston University.

## Research Context

- **Author**: Susan Johnson
- **Institution**: Northeastern University
- **Course**: EDU 7294 Advanced Research Design (R3)
- **Instructor**: Dr. Karen Smith
- **Date**: June 2025
- **Dataset**: SPARC Transcript 4507

## Key Features

### Interactive Elements
- **Draggable nodes**: Reorganize the network layout by dragging any node
- **Hover information**: View detailed information about codes and connections
- **Connection strength**: Visual representation of relationship strength (1-10 scale)
- **Filtering options**: 
  - Show strongest connections only
  - Focus on pattern codes
  - Reset to default view

### Visualization Components
1. **Network Graph**: Shows relationships between all coding levels
2. **Relationship Matrix**: Grid view of connection strengths
3. **Color-coded nodes**: 
   - Blue: In Vivo Codes
   - Orange: Descriptive Codes
   - Green: Pattern Codes
   - Purple: Theoretical Codes
   - Yellow: Key Findings

## Research Questions Addressed

1. Do universities actually practice the interdisciplinarity they promote?
2. What specific institutional mechanisms prevent or enable interdisciplinary collaboration?
3. How can universities align their reward systems with their stated interdisciplinary goals?

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals a fundamental disconnect between universities' rhetorical commitment to interdisciplinarity and their actual institutional practices. The exceptional success of the Kilachand Honors College (with $35 million in external funding) demonstrates that innovation requires extraordinary resources and positioning outside traditional departmental constraints.

## Technical Details
